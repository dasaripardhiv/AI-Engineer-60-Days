Next watch a few videos on prompt engineering 

Implement a few prompts in vertex AI and chatgpt 

For prompting with Chatgpt:
It stands for:

R — Role
T — Task
C — Context
R — Reasoning
O — Output Format
S — Stopping Condition / Style / Scope

It is similar to advanced prompting frameworks like CO-STAR, CRISP, and RTF but more tailored for AI problem-solving and code generation.

🔍 Breakdown with Example
1. Role

Tell the AI who it should behave like.

You are a senior AI engineer and Python expert.

2. Task

What you want the AI to do.

Your task is to explain LSTM in simple terms.

3. Context

Give background information so the AI answers accurately.

Assume the user knows basic neural networks but is new to sequential models.

4. Reasoning

Tell the AI to think step-by-step or logically.

Explain using analogy first, then technical breakdown.

5. Output

Specify exact format so response becomes neat.

Output must contain:

short explanation

real-life example

simple diagram

python sample code

6. Stopping / Style

How to end or limit the response.

Keep the answer under 12 bullet points. No unnecessary jargon.

🔥 Complete RTCROS Prompt Example
R: You are a senior Deep Learning Instructor.
T: Teach LSTM clearly to a beginner ML student.
C: Student knows RNN basics but not gates.
R: Explain step-by-step using analogy first.
O: Provide:
   1. Explanation in simple words
   2. Real world example
   3. A diagram-style text flow
   4. Python code snippet for LSTM
S: Keep answer short, crisp and under 12 bullets.


This produces high-quality, structured answers.
